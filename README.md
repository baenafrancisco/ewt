# EWT Assessment

To deploy this code, a database named fbaenarodriguez, with an user whose username's fbaenarodriguez and whose password's sheethoh must exist, as well as the tables provided in the description.

	-The alternative is changing the database setups under /ewt/poi/core/db.php

To get VisitHampshire working fine, this folder should have been decompressed in the root of an Apache server under the folder /ewt/.
	- The route of the cURL api calls can be changed within /ewt/vh/core/cURLConfig.php.
